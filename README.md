## Project Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an AI-framework for identifying changes in the psychological demeanor of populations in order to better design public policies targeting psychological epidemics. At the time of this writing, the project is still early in development and the work is primarily focused on data acquistion and preliminary exploration/analysis.

## Current Objectives

I am currently exploring approximately 73K responses to the MACH-IV psychological assessment (with an additional optional survey) collected between 2017-2019 ([Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/machivallianism-test)). I aim to identify robust and informative clusters in the data and provide supportive (and easily intelligible) visuals to better understand the behaviors/beliefs of those displaying above/below "normal" levels of Machiavellianism.

For now, I am using Jupyter Notebooks to develop and present my work. The first version (which will include significant code and preliminary comments) of this analysis is currently expected to be released in mid/late December 2023. 

## History of the Project

This project was begun in late May 2023 as a part of the Le Wagon Munich Data Science Coding Bootcamp. I led a team of 3 other developers to create classification models for predicting whether a person would be reported as having atypical levels of psychopathic, narcissistic, or Machiavellian traits based on their response to questionnaires measuring the other two (e.g., if you answered questions targeting psychopatyh and Machiavellianism, the model would predict whether you were above, below, or within typical ranges for narcissism) with accuracy rates between 67% and 77%. 

In the months since this initial version was presented (mid June 2023), I have continued to work on the project independently. The project has been refocused on Machiavellianism alone with the hope of creating a more robust framework from which to build others for different psychological conditions.

This project is being developed independently by me and no part of the work shown here should be taken as a substitute for a medical diagnosis by a trained professional. I am not a doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist. While I have done my best to provide only well researched and ethically sourced data, I am relying on data that was collected by other persons with whom I do not have direct contact. As such, I cannot independently verify that all data was reported correctly or that written procedure was completely followed at all times.
